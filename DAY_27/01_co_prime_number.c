// 5. Write a program to check whether two given numbers are co - prime numbers or not.
/**
 * Co-prime numbers can be identified easily with the help of some properties that are explained below:

 * The Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two coprime numbers is always 1. For example, 5 and 9 are coprime numbers, there, HCF (5, 9) = 1.
 * The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two co-primes is always their product. For example, 5 and 9 are co-prime numbers. Hence, LCM (5, 9) = 45.
 * 1 forms a co-prime number pair with every number.
 * Two even numbers cannot be co-prime numbers as they always have 2 as the common factor.
 * The sum of two co-prime numbers is always co-prime with their product. For example, 5 and 9 are co-prime numbers. Here, 5 + 9 = 14 is co-prime with 5 Ã— 9 = 45.
 * Two prime numbers are always co-prime. They have only 1 as their common factor. Consider 29 and 31. 29 has 2 prime factors, 1 and 29 only. 31 has 2 prime factors, 1 and 31 only. 29 and 31 are prime numbers. They have only one common factor 1. Thus they are co-prime. We can check any two prime numbers and get them as co-prime. For example, 2 and 3, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, and so on.
 * All pairs of two consecutive numbers are co-prime numbers. Any two consecutive numbers have 1 as their common factor
